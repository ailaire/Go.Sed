# Go-Sed 

An implementation of sed in Go.  Just because!


## Implementation Notes

To be written.

## Status

It is early in the development.  There is a basic engine in place, which can run
a few of the commands.  The lexer is coming along, and it can parse all of the common
commands.  I still need to do the 'y' command, but that may be all that's missing.


## Next Steps

The most important missing piece is a parser for the lex'ed tokens. 

After that, I'll need to add code to run the missing commands.


## Go Get

You can get the code/executable by saying:

    go get github.com/waywardcode/go-sed
